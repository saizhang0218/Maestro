This folder includes a verilog implementation of the bit-serial adder tree, which takes the outputs of eight 8 by 8 systolic arrays, and compute the
summation over the corresponding systolic outputs. 

The inputs of top.v is described as follows:
1. clk: the clock input.
2. reset: the reset signal.
3. control: select the systolic output for summation.
4. output_sa0,output_sa1,output_sa2,output_sa3,output_sa4,output_sa5,output_sa6,output_sa7: systolic array outputs.
5. result: the summations.

More functions needs to be added later.
